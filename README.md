# A Client-Server Application

I created a client-server application that runs on Wildfly/JBoss to store information about movies I want to recommend or watch in the future: my personal "IMDb"!

This web app uses EJBs and REST to communicate between the client and the server. It also uses Java Server Faces (JSF) and an open-source component library called PrimeFaces for presenting the data.

Rest client : https://github.com/NatashaDiane/ServerProgrammeringAppRestClient
